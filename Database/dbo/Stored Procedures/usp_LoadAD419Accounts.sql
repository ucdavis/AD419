-- =============================================
-- Author:		Ken Taylor
-- Create date: July 11, 2016
-- Description:	Load the AD419Accounts table.
-- Get a list of all unique accounts that are in the FFY ARC accounts table,
-- plus any missing 204 accounts that were excluded by ARC, etc,
-- and load them into the AD419Accounts table.
-- This table contains a list of all CA&ES accounts, their SFN, and expenses that
-- were pulled from FIS by ARC, plus whatever additional 204 expense accounts that were 
-- outside our ARCs and pulled by OpFundNum 
--
-- Prerequisites:
-- 1. The FFY_ExpensesByARC table must have already been loaded
-- 2. The NewAccountSFN table must have already been loaded
-- 3. The AllAccountsFor204Projects table must have already been loaded
--
-- Usage:
/*
	USE AD419 
	GO

	EXEC usp_LoadAD419Accounts
*/
-- Modifications:
--	2016-08-19 by kjt: Revised to use UFYOrganizationsOrgR_v
--	2017-09-26 by kjt: Removed having clause for adding any missing 204 accounts so that
--		204 accounts with no expenses would also be included; otherwise, we are not ablew to exclude 
--		and re-include them properly.
--	2017-10-12 by kjt: Revised the joins because we already have the Org present in NewAccountSFN,
--		so it is not necessary to do another join on Accounts.
--	2017-10-13 by kjt: Changed FFY_ExpensesByARC join with NewAccountSFN to use OrgXOrgR instead of 
--		UFYOrganizationsOrgR_v since this can change over the year if run retroactively.
