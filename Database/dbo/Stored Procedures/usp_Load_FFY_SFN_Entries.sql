-- Author:		Ken Taylor
-- Create date: July 11, 2016
-- Description:	Load FFY_SFN_Entries
-- This table contains a list of all SFN 20x chart, account, SFN, and associated project, 
-- as well as, whether or not the project has expired.
-- This procedure will attempt to match accounts to projects using their account or OP(UC) 
-- fund award number, but just copy over the 204 project matches as those projects we mapped in
-- a previous step.
--
-- This is one of the final tables to load.
-- Prerequisites:
-- 1. The AllProjectsImport table must have already been loaded.
-- 2. The ARC codes table must have already been loaded.
-- 3. The ARCcodeAccountExclusions must have already been loaded.
-- 4. The NewAccountSFN table must have already been loaded.
-- 5. The FFY_ExpensesByARC table must have already been loaded.
-- 6. The AllAccountsFor204Projects table must have already been loaded.
-- 7. The AD419Accounts table must have already been loaded.
--Usage:
/*
	USE AD419
	GO

	EXEC usp_Load_FFY_SFN_Entries @FiscalYear = 2015
	GO
*/
--
--Modifications:
--  20160819 by kjt: Added logic to exclude projects already in ARCCodeAccountExclusions
