-- =============================================
-- Author:		Ken Taylor
-- Create date: 02/04/2010
-- Description:	This script populates the AD-419
-- database for the Fiscal Year provided.
-- Modifications: 
-- 2010-11-17 by kjt: Added call to execute sp_Set_ACBS_PPS_Expenses_To_BIOS_Orgs,
-- and call to execute sp_Delete_AD419_204_Expenses_After_Identificaion.
--
-- 2010-12-17 by kjt: Removed call to execute sp_Set_ACBS_PPS_Expenses_To_BIOS_Orgs,
-- as this org remapping is now being done in the Expenses view.
--
-- 2011-11-21 by kjt: Added changes to account for AHCE org consolidations.
--	Added call to run sp_Adjust241FTE as per Steve Pesis.
-- 2012-11-05 by kjt: Commented out portion of code that handles populating raw PPS expenses since TOE is no
--	longer available, and we need to populate them using a different longer-running technique.
-- 2012-11-19 by kjt: Revised logic to set nocount ON if @IsDebug = 1.
-- 2012-11-21 by kjt: Added logic to handle this year's project anomalies, specifically in regards to SFN expenses.
-- 2013-11-08 by kjt: Commented out part that updated Titles table as this did not work with synonyms.
--	The statements will need to be run directly against the PPS DataMart Titles tables referenced by the synonym.
--	Also rewrote the "Secondly, update the accession numbers where the quad numbers match:" section to do 
-- a better join as the former one was returning multiple results from the sub query.
-- 2013-11-12 by kjt: Added call to usp_RepopulateProjXOrgRForIntedepartmentalProjects to automatically
-- add interdepartmental projects to ProjXOrgR:
-- 2013-11-13 by kjt: Removed  @FiscalYear parameter from EXEC @return_value = usp_UpdateLaborTransactionsMissingEmployeeNames 
--	as it was not needed and failed because too many parameters were provided otherwise.
-- 2013-11-13 by kjt: Added logic to determine if LaborTransactions table needs to be reloaded automatically 
-- instead of having to remember to uncomment and comment out statement block the first time the sproc is
-- run for the current AD-419 reporting year.
-- 2014-12-29 by kjt: Added logic to call usp_DropAndReCreateExpensesViewForFiscalYear, which handles re-creating
-- the Expenses (view) for the particular FiscalYear so that the correct join is made across the ArcCodeExclusions for 
-- the matching Fiscal Year..  This view also handles remapping CABA expenses to ADNO, BGEN expenses to BMCB, and
-- BCPB expenses to BEVE.
-- Also added the SQL statement to delete all of the expenses for 'ABML', 'AFDS', 'ALAB', and 'USDA' (line 599).
-- 2015-02-25 by kjt: Removed [AD419] specific database references so sproc could be used on other databases
-- such as AD419_2014, etc.

-- Lastly, run sp_INSERT_CABA_EXPENSES_INTO_ASSOCIATIONS. For this last script, you must verify
-- the Account, typically 0067546, and the OrgR, typically ABAE, before running it.
-- sp_INSERT_CABA_EXPENSES_INTO_ASSOCIATIONS zeros out and negative sums AND
-- changes the association OrgR from CABA to ABAE,
-- plus updates the corresponding expense's "isAssociated" bit to 1.
-- This sproc also deletes any unassociated expense that have an OrgR of ABML, AFDS, ALAB, and USDA.

-- 2014-12-29 by kjt: 
-- Since deleting any expenses that had an OrgR of ABML, AFDS, ALAB, or USDA
-- was formerly handled by the call to sp_INSERT_CABA_EXPENSES_INTO_ASSOCIATIONS,
-- which is no longer being called, I am added a manual statement to handle
-- the deletion of those expenses at this point as opposed to after all of the
-- associations have been made:
SELECT @TSQL = '
	DELETE from AllExpenses where isAssociated = 0 AND OrgR in (''ABML'', ''AFDS'', ''ALAB'', ''USDA'')
'
IF @IsDebug = 1
	PRINT @TSQL
ELSE
	EXEC(@TSQL)

END
