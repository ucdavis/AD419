PROGRAM: udf_GetSFNTotalExpenses
BY:	Mike Ransom
--USAGE:	
	udf_GetSFNTotalExpenses('AANS')
	--or
	udf_GetSFNTotalExpenses('ALL')

DESCRIPTION: 

This is a UDF based on the Sproc usp_GetSFNTotalExpenses.  My intention is to try abstracting the queries for the different association status columns (unassociated, associated, total) into UDFs that will return table data types, which can then in turn be easily linked in a single Sproc that can easily  be switched to present either different columns, or all three.

Designed to be a driving query for the right side of the Information page, where expenses are subtotaled for each AD419 line number.  One of the goals was to try to get a procedure that would return a single dataset to the calling procedure in order to abstract the complexity of assembling the various subtotals.

The consuming data grid will also be used to display subtotals for associated or unassociated expenses.  Note that "total" expenses comes from the Expenses table and that "associated" expenses will need to come from the Associations table; the unassociated, I believe, will have to be the difference, and require both of the previous queries to calculate.

This query links to the Expenses table via the SFN_Display table in order to pick up display info for the presentation layer. It doesn't specify anything about the presentation except the display order.  Some rows contain headings for SFN groups, others the subtotals for SFN groups, and each SFN group has a heading line. The SFN_Display table does contain a row type attribute for the presentation layer to discover what row type it is, e.g. "Heading", "SFN", "GroupSum", and "GrandTotal."

Has a parameter @OrgR to use as a filter of Expenses.OrgR so expenses for just one reporting org are returned. Setting to 'ALL' switches result to sum of all departments.

Has an error trap for invalid OrgR code--does a lookup of OrgR codes from Departments table. Returns -1 in @Return if not found.

MODIFICATIONS:

	Functional without parameters limiting reporting org.  Returns results from 2004-5 Expenses table (14,000) records in <1 second, which is really impressive, since it sums each expense record 3 times--once in SFN subtotal, 2nd in SFN Group subtotal, and 3rd in Grand total. (Actually 4th and 5th because of FTE subtotals and grand total.

[10/2/06] Mon
	Added parameter for Reporting Org (OrgR).
	Added condition testing for OrgR = 'ALL' to return sum of expenses for all departments (used 'ALL' due to DataOps not handling nulls).
	Added error trap for invalid OrgR code--does a lookup of OrgR codes from Departments table. Returns -1 in @Return if not found.
	In SFN_Display table, changed LineTypeCode to "FTE" and "FTETotal" so consumer can distinguish and not present in currency format.

[10/4/06] Wed
	Was getting result row with 49.something FTE but no other data due to blank value in Expenses.FTE_SFN.
	This is a problem with the FoxPro data set from last year that shouldn't have occurred.
	We need to guard both against this occurring, and against presenting any blank rows if they do exist.
	Preventing the row from output is done with the following line in the FTE section:
	SFN NOT LIKE '   '

[10/5/06] Thu
	Converting to this UDF.
	Add a AD419Valid flag field to Departments table to filter out old depts not in use.
